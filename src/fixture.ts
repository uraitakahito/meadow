 * ## Why a value, not a yes/no
 *
 * A shared browser context lives as long as the worker, so "the first visit

 * suite pass once and fail on the second run. "The second visit sees the tag
 * the first visit wrote" holds however dirty the context already was.
 *
 * ## Why one JSON object, not one element per store
 *
 * Adding a store used to mean three edits: an element here, a line of script
 * here, and a regex in the consumer's test. With a single JSON payload the
 * consumer's reader never changes — a new store is one more key.
 *
 * ## Which store is which
 *
 *   cookie   — read server-side; it is HttpOnly, so the page cannot see it.
 *              Carried by the browser context.
 *   local    — localStorage. Carried by the browser context.
 *   session  — sessionStorage. Carried by the *tab*, which is why it is the
 *              only one of the three that can tell "same context" apart from
 *              "same tab".
 *
 * Rendered into `<pre id="arrival">` rather than a `<script type="application/json">`
