# node:26 no longer ships corepack — it was unbundled from Node in 25, so the

# enabling it: corepack is what reads `packageManager` from package.json and
# checks its sha512, which installing pnpm directly would skip.

# The fingerprint /__version reports. The build context has no .git
# (.dockerignore), so generate-version.mjs reads these rather than asking git.

# signal: it was baked without recording what it was baked from.

# `prebuild` runs generate-version.mjs off the two ARGs above. pnpm skips
# pre/post scripts unless told otherwise, so this only works because
# pnpm-workspace.yaml sets enablePrePostScripts — and it fails in two different
# ways depending on the tree. Here, where the context carries no
# src/generated/, tsc stops with TS2307; in a working copy that already has one
# the build succeeds and bakes in a stale revision.

# The production tree, built in a stage of its own from nothing.
#
# Not `pnpm deploy`, which BrowserHive uses: that selects a project out of a
# workspace, and meadow's pnpm-workspace.yaml declares no packages — it exists
# only for allowBuilds and enablePrePostScripts, so `deploy` stops with
# ERR_PNPM_NOTHING_TO_DEPLOY.
#
# Nor `pnpm install --prod` on top of the build stage: pruning rewrites a
# node_modules holding the whole dev tree, and committing that layer wedged
# capping's builder for twenty minutes with the install itself reporting
# "Done in 267ms". Installing into an empty stage writes the two runtime
# packages and nothing else.
#
# --node-linker=hoisted gives the runtime stage a flat tree of real directories.
#
# The sibling repositories justify this flag by saying pnpm's default layout
# symlinks into a store the runtime stage will not have. That is not what
# happens: the links are relative and point at node_modules/.pnpm/, which is
# inside the directory being copied, so the store is only needed at install
# time. Measured, not assumed — an image built without the flag starts and
# answers /health, and the two trees differ by 8 files and 1 MB.
#
# It is kept because a runtime image should not depend on symlinks surviving
# `COPY --from`, image export and a registry round trip intact, and because a
# flat node_modules is what anything inspecting the shipped image will expect.
# Not because the default would break here.
